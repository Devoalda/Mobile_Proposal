\section{Problem Statement}\label{problem_statement}
The challenge at hand involves new students at SIT facing a \textbf{significant academic leap} from their previous educational experiences. The transition to university life brings forth various obstacles, including \textit{adapting to a different teaching style} and \textit{managing a more demanding workload}. This situation is a common struggle among \textbf{freshmen}, impacting their overall learning experience. The goal is to understand and address these challenges effectively by designing supportive educational systems and strategies that aid students in \textit{navigating the complexities of university life}, fostering a \textit{smoother transition}, and enhancing their learning journey.

\section{Implications}\label{implications}
Without proactive measures to support students in their transition to university life, there is a risk of \textbf{increased academic stress}, \textit{reduced satisfaction with the learning experience}, and potentially \textit{higher dropout rates}. Recognizing and addressing these challenges is crucial for the overall success and well-being of students, emphasizing the need for institutions to invest in \textit{tailored support systems}, \textit{mentorship programs}, and \textit{teaching methodologies} that facilitate a more seamless adaptation to the demands of higher education.
