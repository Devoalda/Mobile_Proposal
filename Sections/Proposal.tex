\section{Problem Statement}\label{problem_statement}
The challenge at hand involves new students at SIT facing a \textbf{significant academic leap} from their previous educational experiences. The transition to university life brings forth various obstacles, including \textit{adapting to a different teaching style} and \textit{managing a more demanding workload}. This situation is a common struggle among \textbf{freshmen}, impacting their overall learning experience. The goal is to understand and address these challenges effectively by designing supportive educational systems and strategies that aid students in \textit{navigating the complexities of university life}, fostering a \textit{smoother transition}, and enhancing their learning journey.

\section{Implications}\label{implications}
Without proactive measures to support students in their transition to university life, there is a risk of \textbf{increased academic stress}, \textit{reduced satisfaction with the learning experience}, and potentially \textit{higher dropout rates}. Recognizing and addressing these challenges is crucial for the overall success and well-being of students, emphasizing the need for institutions to invest in \textit{tailored support systems}, \textit{mentorship programs}, and \textit{teaching methodologies} that facilitate a more seamless adaptation to the demands of higher education.

\section{Proposed Solution}
\label{proposed_solution}

Building upon the identified challenges, we propose a multifaceted solution designed to elevate the university experience.

\subsection{A Peer-to-Peer Learning Platform}

Inspired by popular platforms like Reddit and Instagram, our application fosters a forum-like environment where students, like Alex, can:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Ask questions and seek answers directly from peers.
  \item Upvote and prioritize valuable responses through a refined voting system.
  \item Browse a curated feed of questions tailored to their interests.
  \item Follow specific tags and explore a wider range of inquiries through a dedicated "Explore" page.
  \item Manage their profiles and interactions effectively.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technology Stack}

This solution leverages a blend of technologies to ensure optimal functionality:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Networking:} Robust interactions and information exchange are facilitated through APIs from Firebase and Google AI.
  \item \textbf{Databases:} Secure and efficient data storage and retrieval are achieved using a combination of SQLite (cache) and Firebase databases.
  \item \textbf{Multimedia:} The platform integrates video and photo functionalities, allowing students to capture and share memorable moments, enriching their learning experience.
  \item \textbf{Optical Character Recognition (OCR):} Streamlining academic endeavors, OCR technology converts printed or handwritten text into digital formats, enhancing organization and accessibility of study materials.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Motivation}

This project is driven by a commitment to easing the academic transition for new university students. Recognizing the common challenges faced by freshmen, we aim to create a supportive online community where students can learn and grow together. This platform empowers introverted students to voice their questions and fosters a collaborative environment where peers can assist each other during this crucial phase.
